def randint(low, high=None, size=None, dtype=None, **kwargs):
    """Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).

    Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of
    the specified dtype in the "half-open" interval [`low`, `high`). If
    `high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : int
        Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
        ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is one above the
        *highest* such integer).
    high : int, optional
        If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
        from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
        single value is returned.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their
        name, i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder is not available
        and a specific precision may have different C types depending
        on the platform. The default value is 'np.int'.
    ctx : Context, optional
        Device context of output. Default is current context.
    out : ndarray, optional
        The output ndarray (default is `None`).

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray of ints
        `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
        distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.random.randint(2, size=10)
    array([1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
    >>> np.random.randint(1, size=10)
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

    Generate a 2 x 4 array of ints between 0 and 4, inclusive:

    >>> np.random.randint(5, size=(2, 4))
    array([[4, 0, 2, 1],
        [3, 2, 2, 0]])

    Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
    ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
    any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
    by `uniform`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : float, ndarray, optional
        Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
    high : float, ndarray, optional
        Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a scalar tensor containing a single value is returned if
        ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
    dtype : {'float16', 'float32', 'float64'}, optional
        Data type of output samples. Default is 'float32'
    ctx : Context, optional
        Device context of output. Default is current context.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.

    """Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

    Samples are distributed according to a normal distribution parametrized
    by *loc* (mean) and *scale* (standard deviation).


    Parameters
    ----------
    loc : float, optional
        Mean (centre) of the distribution.
    scale : float, optional
        Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
        samples are drawn. If size is `None` (default), a scalar tensor containing
        a single value is returned if loc and scale are both scalars.
    dtype : {'float16', 'float32', 'float64'}, optional
        Data type of output samples. Default is 'float32'
    ctx : Context, optional
        Device context of output. Default is current context.
    out : ``ndarray``, optional
        Store output to an existing ``ndarray``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    This function currently does not support ``loc`` and ``scale`` as ndarrays.
